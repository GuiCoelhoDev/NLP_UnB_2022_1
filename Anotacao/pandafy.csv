2022-04-12 22:13:22,"What is going on, Spotify? Nothing will play no matter what I do. Fix it."
2022-02-21 15:58:15,"Music that's matched to me, spot on!!!!! Thanks Spotify I wrote that 9 word review 2 years ago and now, in 2022 I don't need to say anything more. It's still my go to music app every single day. I don't know what I would do without it. Spotify is like my dog, a Moodchanger & a Lifesaver! You Rock Spotify !!!"
2022-04-29 08:49:34,Lots of bugs in the latest version
2022-03-23 08:13:13,"Damn, Spotify used to be an amazing streaming platform before. But now, I couldn't even play musics in my playlist at full length under my command. If I were to do so it must be on shuffle, what's this? Becoming more money hungry as time passes by? Or yall just really want to receive 1 ‚≠ê ratings all over?"
2022-06-15 02:39:28,Never have been annoyed in my entire life than while using this application
2022-05-01 10:39:46,Spot On! Thank you for all the jams tunes and songs that help me get along! Bong Bong Spotify till I Fly!
2022-04-19 16:40:54,The app recently is giving everyone i know on the app no matter what service trouble. It won't load properly or play music. Downloaded music has issue and it will start playing but won't give you an option to pause or skip or play. Its has the app open but no song actually playing. Plz help
2022-06-13 05:00:27,"I Love spotify!!! The only thing I wish they had was a button to click on that brought me to a music video, like YouTube has."
2022-03-17 02:23:27,"Been using spotify since 2017, maybe later. Haven't had any qualms with the app or the music found on it, or not found. My Playlist is over 2k and counting. Thanks for having all the metal and hard rock a metal head could ask for."
2022-06-22 12:59:24,All the music I like in one easy to navigate app
2022-05-08 08:02:50,Love it. Best music app ever. I travel a lot and go to rural areas with poor or no coverage at all. My offline music is always there to keep me company.
2022-06-17 11:10:54,"The bloody autoplay feature just won't stop! It keeps playing random songs I don't like and didn't even added to the Playlist despite disabling it in the settings. After playing those annoying songs, ads roll in that lasts for like a minute or so. Instead of putting me in a good mood, it did the exact opposite. Don't use this app unless you have the budget for premium subscription. LISTENING MUSIC ON YOUTUBE IS WAY BETTER THAN AN APP LITERALLY CREATED FOR LISTENING MUSIC."
2022-07-01 16:05:50,Love group listen and shared playlists
2022-03-30 15:00:00,"One of the most annoying music playing apps ever, why are there limited skips, if I don't like a song I cant skip it if I don't have enough skips, also if I search up a song and want to play it I won't let me unless I add it to my Playlist, and even then it won't work because Spotify adds songs to your Playlist for no reason, which wouldn't be much of a problem if the default wasn't on shuffle to play music in your Playlist, this app is way to complicated to use and I would not recommend at all"
2022-04-22 18:11:29,Minor glitches but all around good times
2022-06-14 14:32:36,Just want to say I loved the app at first but now it locked me out of all my downloads my library a my liked songs my artist that I download and it's not playing any music now I just want to know what's going on?
2022-04-06 03:27:30,Spotify has an amazing way of noting music you love and creating a playlist for you that at your best and worst mood they are with you. Keep up the good work SPOT. Thank you.
2022-05-24 14:52:18,"Great app. Has almost all the songs I look for. Their premium family plan is so so worth it. There's absolutely no restrictions on playlists and other such organisations for the paid plan. Useful features are added quite frequently. Love the swipe to add to queue feature. Song and playing radios, and other song suggestions are quite apt"
2022-04-23 03:33:18,"You can access all ur favourite songs in your playlist, listen to your favorite artist or short storys. It has good quality and easy to be happy and sing all your problems away. Best to use speakers or headphones. Honestly this app is full of happiness and love."
2022-04-11 16:16:15,Update Extremely Bugged. Please revert to old update. Search bar isn't formatted and is cut off. Can play music but doesn't actually visually show any song was selected.
2022-02-24 21:27:24,Its buggy as hell. Random pauses. no control panel to play/pause. Its very frustrating to use and navigate.
2022-07-07 14:25:44,All of my favorite podcasts from all aspects of my recreational life to my professional life in one place.
2022-04-15 10:05:20,"Bugged since a few days. No longer showing what is currently playing (in-app), no bar in notification area and doesn't stop music after a bluetooth device disconnects."
2022-04-19 04:38:38,It's good untill you go pronium then if you don't pay you can't usa at all sucky
2022-07-05 23:28:28,"Right now as soon as I start vacation it is not working, not loading. I've uninstalled, reinstalled, forced stopped, restarted my phone. This is beyond annoying!!! Edit, got a new phone and app still not working!!! Everyone else in my family plan has a working spotify except myself and I am the plan account holder."
2022-05-04 12:17:33,"I love Spotify! I use it for my personally and for my business, I love how it's easy to use and some of the Spotify playlists are perfect."
2022-07-05 18:47:32,"Everything is almost alright. Whenever I play my liked songs shuffled, after couple of my liked songs are played a little after you play song THAT I NEVER LIKED WHY PLAY THEM WHEN I HAVEN'T LIKED THEM. FIX THIS. Not only that every 10 minutes i get an add. Don't hmu with the bs of not bothering you with adds for 30 minutes. THANKS FOR DISABLING MY ACCOUNT AFTER I WROTE THIS, everything was fine before I rated this."
2022-03-19 02:44:07,This so good when I am feeling so sad I listen to music in spotify
2022-03-04 16:49:24,It's a very nice app actually BUT the thing that is really annoying me so bad is that it's with Internet hopefully Spotify would fix this problem thank you
2022-02-02 14:29:16,"Awesome app! Ignore the haters/fakers. wAy better than other options! Thanks! Thanks for the great music,awesome playlists, and great quality sound. I have tried about a dozen other apps, this is by far my favorite (and the rest of the family, we all use it! I definitely recommend this for all your music listening needs! Thanks spotify for standing up for what is right! I enjoy joe rogan podcast. It's one of the few completely honest places left!"
2022-05-03 21:21:56,- Pauses continually every 15 min - Will play in the background with no way of pausing unless the app is force stopped - Multiple prompts a day for Bluetooth access - Occasionally won't open through widget - More bugs continually occuring in the last 3 months
2022-06-02 20:04:17,I've used Spotify exclusively for my music for over 10 years now. It's the best I can recommend. Free version on mobile kind of sucks - but premium isn't very expensive at all especially as a student.
2022-06-07 04:22:46,"To the team of spotify, this is to inform you that I dont have any active subscription and i haven't paid one(not even the tried the trial) but I'm not getting any advertisements in the middle of playlists like the premium users... please check what it is! Thank you!"
2022-04-26 23:31:34,"Literally the worst app ever made. No matter what you do. No matter what setting you engage, you cannot stop it from starting automatically when you hop in your car and it connects to Bluetooth. Nothing can stop it. It just kicks in and starts rocking. Let's say you were playing the song loud in your house and then you get in your car. It's going to come out blasting. Why is autoplay so hard to stop? I feel like they're programming team simply doesn't have the skills. I hate this app."
2022-04-17 08:26:02,The best music experience you will ever have ‚ù§
2022-04-23 14:37:49,"I constantly have to re-download all my music. When I find something new to download, and I have a subscription, and phone has room, it always just spins and doesn't DL. I follow all the steps recommended and in the end I have to reinstall it, re download everything. F*$king pain in the a$$. If it didn't have such a large download limit, I'd have gone with YouTube instead. I miss Google music."
2022-05-08 02:39:26,it is so good and convinent and it is so much better than YouTube music
2022-05-04 16:57:17,I am enjoying the music and it's such a wide variety.
2022-04-18 15:36:24,"The app is great, I know - but the fact that u can't even play the complete song when you search it up without Spotify Premium just makes it basically unusable. You can only play playlist, that's all. Spotify pls fix this."
2022-02-01 17:04:52,"Usually I like Spotify and even use Premium, but lately, every time there is an update, the apl crashes as soon as I start playing a song, which really makes the app very useless. Mostly this issue is resolved after some time, but it keeps coming up. Without this problem, I would give Spotify at least 4 stars. Please fix it."
2022-06-13 04:39:24,I love it there's not much adds either all music is free and it's free to make a podcast
2022-07-02 20:40:43,"This app has lots of podcasts and I love those , you can also try these podcasts of Crime & Thriller."
2022-05-13 20:16:36,Where do I start well Spotify was the last musical platform that I added to my music app ecosystem I already have YouTube music and SoundCloud and Spotify has been a welcome addition I love the fact that I have the ability to search for singles remixes and albums from all three what I enjoy doing is opening Spotify and SoundCloud in split screen view and being able to blend and mix between the twoüéõÔ∏è
2022-03-25 18:27:18,This app sucks you can't even listen to the right music i wanted to listen to panic at the disco but i had to listwn to a whole differenet music before i could listen to panic at the disco youtube is way better also I have Spotify on my Playstation when it goes to an add break you have to sit through 4 different ads that could range from 30 seconds to 2 minutes and they are only about buy Spotify premium
2022-06-22 21:12:35,It's good but why can't we play offline music
2022-03-20 20:30:21,The app will stop playing songs after 2 songs. I have to open my Spotify to restart it every time. It does get annoying. Maybe a good update will help?
2022-03-11 23:02:05,"No problems so far, been using it about 2 years now. Easy to navigate, easy to use."
2022-04-20 21:45:33,I can find any song I want on this app. I love this!!!!
2022-06-28 09:12:11,"Very outstanding app for songs, podcasts : ) :D"
2022-03-13 06:44:07,"Usually great, but lately keeps shutting off mid song. Very annoying!!!"
2022-03-04 02:35:25,I hate this app I heard it was great but I want to play a song but then it shuffles with other songs I don't even like then I try to skip the song but it won't allow me and it says I only get 6 skips per HOUR I would give 0.001 of a star but I only get to put 1 so good enough. PLEASE MAKE BETTER NOWWW!!!!
2022-04-11 22:56:31,"I love spotify, but the app is awful. It often just decides not to load pages at all, or lag out in other way. Recently, when I play a song, the sound plays but nothing in the UI changes (I.e. it doesn't display the song is playing, meaning I can't skip the song or change the shuffle setting etc.). Very infuriating that such a popular app could work so badly."
2022-05-27 21:57:45,"Download podcasts but they won't play without an internet connection. What's the point? You can't listen to them offline. Edit:won't even play a single podcast all they through, part way through always skips to another episode with you hing anything."
2022-02-22 15:29:04,"Used to love it! All of a sudden - after the last update I guess - my Spotify will not show up on my lock screen. No matter what setting I change, I've logged out, I've reinstalled, nothing works.. Other than that, I have no complaints but this really sucks"
2022-03-13 15:20:05,The best music app out there. Not obly does it let you organize and find you own music but it helps find new artists and songs and podcasts that fit your vibe anytime. Its super organized and easy to use. Definitely my favorite app.
2022-02-23 06:20:01,the recent update was so problematic and laggy. it won't let me use the premium features bc it keep crashing whenever i'm about to buy my premium plan. said there was no network so i have to uninstalled and re-installed it again. pls help me to fix it. thanks.
2022-04-24 02:16:24,Music is th life n Spotify is th best app to listen th music
2022-07-06 02:50:05,Very good app.i listen to lots of music on hear
2022-03-29 04:07:51,"Will choose this app over pandora. Just like that. I like this app and enjoying, keep up the good work"
2022-06-16 07:32:06,Vere cofartable and very clear sound I like very much
2022-02-11 22:24:55,"Nice, you have nice songs almost all the categories."
2022-05-07 01:44:29,"Imagine searching for a song and when you play it, it plays another song."
2022-06-11 23:56:11,I like being able to play music even when my phone is off
2022-04-21 04:55:55,Awesome App for listening to songs...Has a vast collection of songs and is available for all platforms..which makes it very easy to use.. Android app has bugs though..!! Doesn't work on my Wi-Fi sometimes.. Hopefully the pesky bugs are removed ASAP...
2022-05-20 01:10:15,music keeps randomly playing on its own. the app will be completely closed and then suddenly opens by itself. cannot find a solution to this.
2022-01-22 15:54:22,Loving it so far. Would recommend over Apple Music any day.
2022-05-13 14:43:40,"As amazing as it is to get to listen to the music YOU love, it would be nice if you just got THAT, not the excessive amount of recommended songs this bull app gives when you just want to listen to an album. No, Spotify, I would not like to hear the 50 million additional songs you've added to my playlist for me to try. Why? Because it is MY PLAYLIST with the songs I like, not you and your people, ME!"
2022-06-25 08:18:26,Has all the songs and bands I listen too...
2022-06-13 20:24:55,Please fix the shuffle function - it's literally been broken for years. I have to uninstall and reinstall often. Please fix this basic function
2022-07-03 04:01:57,Sound quality in premium category has decreased. Earlier I was really impressed compare to any other music streaming app.
2022-01-31 05:08:08,"One less star just for the lack of a clear queue button in the app.. I keep getting the same darn podcast that auto plays.. Glitch city. What is the point of downloading songs or episodes when the app just streams anyway. If I have a connection to the internet, the podcast I'm listening to keeps buffering. If I disconnect, then it runs fine. So glitchy"
2022-04-19 21:34:01,Spotify changes my songs by itself. It's fustrating especially when I'm driving and there's not jack I can do about it.
2022-06-20 11:26:11,I thoroughly enjoy the app it's super easy to use and the search results are endless from Playlist to song I've never known exist from artists I love
2022-04-13 22:29:00,Please fix the play situation. It's not showing the medis controls on lock screens or even in Spotify app. The only way for me to stop the music is by completely closing the app.
2022-06-01 03:11:49,"Great , wish I could download and keep my play list..."
2022-03-31 11:40:55,"Premium customer for nearly a decade but it seems a bit ridiculous to pay $10 a month for an app with such awful load times, ignored bugs (which are mentioned in nearly every 1 star review) and routine crashes. I feel like for everytime this app is rendered useless, we should receive a credit on our accounts or something. I literally paid $10 for an icon on my phone last month. Maybe a better development and security team is needed, who knows."
2022-07-08 22:23:23,"Rn I am unable to pause, skip & play music in my spotify playlist. I usually had that bar that allows you to pause, play & skip to the next song when you minimize the spotify app to have music play in the background but its not there anymore. If I play a song from my playlist the next song in that playlist does not play for some reason. Or if I want to pause a song that is playing I'd have to close the app entirely. I have this problem whether I use my earbuds or not. I've never had this problem"
2022-01-25 16:12:55,It have too much add uf a person who can't buy the premium they force him to take spotify premium by their adds....this is not my review it's a problem of mine...üò§üò§üò°üò°üò°
2022-04-06 20:11:11,Much better than when I first used it more than a decade ago. I'm yet to know any other music repository like it. I duff my hat for Spotify!
2022-04-02 01:17:06,The mobile experience is horrible without Premium. SoundCloud offers so much more for so much less. Not worth it.
2022-07-04 01:26:12,"The play bar keeps disappearing. Only restarting the phone fixes it, but then it disappears again. This problem has been known for 2 months and still not fixed"
2022-03-19 22:16:24,"It really irritates me that my playlists keep getting removed from my homescreen and replaced by podcasts I accidentally clicked on. Now I permanently have 2 absolutely random podcasts on my homescreen in which I have 0 interests. I have to navigate so much through the app just to get to my playlist. Please fix this, I have no interest in the podcast side of spotify"
2022-03-28 09:23:36,ads were reduced earlier but they are significantly increased again... There are two ad after every 2 songs like how do you want us to use this app
2022-06-24 02:22:19,Love it but it's been laggy lately
2022-05-07 10:58:43,a little low price would be superb
2022-06-02 05:55:31,Bad experience. Too many ads.
2022-06-17 08:41:34,Great music and songs üéµ üëå üé∂
2022-03-20 18:18:17,Song recommendations are good. Bollywood recommendations need to improve. Ads should decrease. English lyrics are really required for non-English songs.
2022-06-09 02:01:11,Love it! Been enjoying the streaming. Good Playlist features. Been recently loving the lyrics.
2022-07-08 22:09:51,Good free music. Easy to use.
2022-05-01 14:48:00,Ads when you pay money for a service is totally unacceptable. Makes the service annoying to use and they have broken their podcast feature
2022-03-19 10:07:28,This app is trash. I only use it for Joe Rogan podcasts. I pay for it and it still keeps glitching and will randomly change episodes and i will have to start the episode from scratch when i come back to it because it dose not keep a record of where you left it
2022-04-14 19:31:34,"Since 8.7.20.1261 playbar goes missing, plays or stops randomly, plays multiple songs at once. Doesn't clear up after force close or reboots. Really annoyed since I actually pay for this app."
2022-05-09 05:47:08,I want to share with friends for a long time without changing accounts. Why can I only join another Premium once a year?
2022-04-23 02:18:23,It will not let me play my play list with out shuffling or adding song that are not in my play list so fix this please i have not had this promblem befor but other than that it is a good streaming platform
2022-03-16 20:53:19,Great app good selection of songs use it to listen daily
2022-06-02 02:49:38,I'm happy üòäüòä and relax every to listen .my favorite song play on Spotify thanks.
2022-04-20 14:36:30,Full of ads
2022-04-21 19:53:50,I no longer have the option to preview songs.
2022-06-23 15:58:09,My only problem random song shuffled.i want to listen to unstoppable sound and it randomly shuffle the song to happier.other tan that it's op
